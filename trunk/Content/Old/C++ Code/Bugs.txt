(X) Think is fixed, but so hard to reproduce that I can't say for sure
(A) Crash or cannot continue or will keep us from being approved
(B) Significant Bug, but can get around to continue playing, no way we'll ship with it unless it's hard to reproduce
(C) Insignificant Bug, something we'd like to fix, particularly if it's easy, but will ship w/ it if needed
(D) Design Improvement/Bug Do if time permits
(?) Haven't seen this in a while, might somehow be fixed
(!) Not fixed, hard to reproduce

(1A?) Game Locks up if you start clicking too often

(1B!) If everyone passes, game subtracts points from team who didn't save their meld, even if they didn't take bid
(2B!) if team A has meld when team B does not have enough to play hand, the scores are not always reflected (this does work when team doesn't have a marriage)
(3B!) Sometimes, two people bid same amount (might be when they are bidding on a run)
(4BX) After getting a lot of meld, +127 over bid, the game says you need a lot to get
(5B!) Scoreboard breaks sometimes, not sure why

(1D) Support aspect ratios of 1.3333 (done), 1.6f, then 1.7f (Kindle Fire)
(2D) Need better sounds--take to Ryan
